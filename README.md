# PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

## Institute of Protein Research RAS | 2021 - Present
- Working with chromatin accessibility data (ATAC-seq, DRIP-seq,
CHIP-seq), identifying allele-specific binding of transcription
factors to regulatory variants in U2OS cell line. My role is to
develop the basic pipeline for variant calling

- Annotation and enrichment analysis of allele-specific
transcription factor binding at SNPs. My role was to annotate
the main significant SNPs found in the COVID19-hg GWAS
meta-analysis
## Central Scientific Research Laboratory of SSMU | 2020
Performing statistical analysis of clinical data
Another project is dedicated to the relationship between biliary
microbiota and bile acids composition in cholelithiasis. Preprocessing of 16S sequencing data and assessment of ecological
metrics are performed
## Summer School on Bioinformatics | 2019
RNA-seq data processing, studying how transcriptome changes
as cells mature
